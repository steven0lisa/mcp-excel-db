# F-8: LIMIT Clause

## Feature Description
Support LIMIT clause to restrict the number of rows returned by a query.

## Supported Syntax
- `LIMIT count` - Return first N rows
- `LIMIT offset, count` - Skip offset rows, then return count rows

## Examples

### Basic Limit
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 LIMIT 10
```

### Limit with Offset
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 LIMIT 5, 10
```

### Limit with ORDER BY
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 
ORDER BY created_date DESC 
LIMIT 5
```

### Pagination Example
```sql
-- First page (rows 1-10)
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 ORDER BY id LIMIT 10

-- Second page (rows 11-20)
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 ORDER BY id LIMIT 10, 10

-- Third page (rows 21-30)
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 ORDER BY id LIMIT 20, 10
```

### Limit with WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY last_login DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Limit with JOIN
```sql
SELECT u.name, p.title
FROM users u
INNER JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
ORDER BY p.created_date DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Top N Query
```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM Sheet1 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 3
```

## Implementation Details
- LIMIT is applied after all other clauses (WHERE, ORDER BY, etc.)
- Offset is 0-based (LIMIT 5, 10 means skip 5 rows, return next 10)
- If offset exceeds total rows, empty result is returned
- If count exceeds remaining rows, all remaining rows are returned
- Works efficiently with large datasets by limiting processing
- Combines well with ORDER BY for consistent results
