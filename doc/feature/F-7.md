# F-7: ORDER BY Clause

## Feature Description
Support ORDER BY clause to sort query results in ascending or descending order.

## Supported Syntax
- `ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC]`
- `ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC` (multiple columns)
- `ORDER BY expression` (expressions and functions)

## Examples

### Basic Ascending Order
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 ORDER BY name
```

### Descending Order
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 ORDER BY age DESC
```

### Multiple Column Sorting
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 
ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC
```

### Order by Expression
```sql
SELECT name, age FROM Sheet1 
ORDER BY LENGTH(name), age DESC
```

### Order by Function Result
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 
ORDER BY UPPER(name), created_date DESC
```

### Order with WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY last_login DESC
```

### Order with JOIN
```sql
SELECT u.name, p.title
FROM users u
INNER JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
ORDER BY u.name, p.created_date DESC
```

## Implementation Details
- Default sort order is ASC (ascending)
- Supports multiple sort columns with different directions
- NULL values are sorted last in ascending order, first in descending order
- Expressions and function calls are evaluated for sorting
- Stable sorting algorithm preserves original order for equal values
- Works with all data types (string, numeric, date)
