# F-6: Math Functions

## Feature Description
Support various mathematical functions for numeric calculations in SQL queries.

## Supported Functions

### ABS(number)
Returns the absolute value of a number.
```sql
SELECT ABS(balance) FROM Sheet1
```

### ROUND(number, decimals)
Rounds a number to specified decimal places.
```sql
SELECT ROUND(price, 2) FROM Sheet1
```

### CEIL(number)
Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number.
```sql
SELECT CEIL(rating) FROM Sheet1
```

### FLOOR(number)
Returns the largest integer less than or equal to the number.
```sql
SELECT FLOOR(score) FROM Sheet1
```

### RANDOM()
Returns a random number between 0 and 1.
```sql
SELECT RANDOM() AS random_value FROM Sheet1
```

## Examples

### Combined Math Functions
```sql
SELECT 
  price,
  ROUND(price * 1.1, 2) AS price_with_tax,
  ABS(discount) AS abs_discount
FROM Sheet1
```

### Math Functions in WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 
WHERE ABS(balance) > 1000 AND ROUND(score, 0) >= 80
```

### Math Functions with Aggregates
```sql
SELECT 
  category,
  ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price,
  CEIL(MAX(quantity)) AS max_quantity
FROM Sheet1 
GROUP BY category
```

### Random Sampling
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 
WHERE RANDOM() < 0.1
ORDER BY RANDOM()
```

## Implementation Details
- All functions handle NULL values by returning NULL
- ROUND function supports negative decimal places for rounding to tens, hundreds, etc.
- RANDOM() generates different values for each row
- Functions can be nested and combined with other expressions
- Proper type conversion for numeric operations
