# F-5: String Functions

## Feature Description
Support various string manipulation functions for text processing in SQL queries.

## Supported Functions

### LENGTH(string)
Returns the length of a string.
```sql
SELECT LENGTH(name) FROM Sheet1
```

### UPPER(string)
Converts string to uppercase.
```sql
SELECT UPPER(name) FROM Sheet1
```

### LOWER(string)
Converts string to lowercase.
```sql
SELECT LOWER(email) FROM Sheet1
```

### TRIM(string)
Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
```sql
SELECT TRIM(description) FROM Sheet1
```

### SUBSTR(string, start, length)
Extracts substring from a string.
```sql
SELECT SUBSTR(phone, 1, 3) AS area_code FROM Sheet1
```

### INSTR(string, substring)
Returns the position of substring in string (1-based index).
```sql
SELECT INSTR(email, '@') FROM Sheet1
```

### REPLACE(string, search, replacement)
Replaces all occurrences of search string with replacement.
```sql
SELECT REPLACE(phone, '-', '') FROM Sheet1
```

## Examples

### Combined String Functions
```sql
SELECT 
  UPPER(TRIM(name)) AS clean_name,
  LENGTH(description) AS desc_length
FROM Sheet1
```

### String Functions in WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 
WHERE LENGTH(name) > 5 AND UPPER(status) = 'ACTIVE'
```

### String Functions with Aliases
```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  SUBSTR(email, 1, INSTR(email, '@') - 1) AS username
FROM Sheet1
```

## Implementation Details
- All functions handle NULL values gracefully
- SUBSTR uses 1-based indexing (SQL standard)
- INSTR returns 0 if substring not found
- Functions can be nested and combined
- Case-sensitive operations except for UPPER/LOWER
