## Feature Description
Support WHERE clause for filtering data based on various conditions.

## Supported Operators
- Comparison: `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- Logical: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- Pattern matching: `LIKE`
- Null checks: `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`
- Range checks: `BETWEEN`
- List checks: `IN`, `NOT IN`

## Examples

### Basic Comparison
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 WHERE age > 18
```

### Logical Operations
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 WHERE age > 18 AND status = 'active'
```

### Pattern Matching
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 WHERE name LIKE 'John%'
```

### Null Checks

```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 65
```

### List Checks
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 WHERE category IN ('A', 'B', 'C')
```

## Implementation Details
- Supports nested conditions with parentheses
- Type coercion for numeric comparisons
- Case-insensitive LIKE operations
- Proper handling of NULL values
