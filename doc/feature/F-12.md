# F-12: Double-Quoted Identifiers Support

## Feature Description
Support ANSI SQL standard double-quoted identifiers for column names and table names containing special characters like dots, spaces, etc. This allows users to query Excel columns with special characters in their names.

## Supported Syntax
- `SELECT "column.name" FROM table_name` - Column names with dots
- `SELECT "column with spaces" FROM table_name` - Column names with spaces
- `SELECT "Purch.Doc." FROM Sheet1` - Real-world example with dots
- `SELECT * FROM Sheet1 WHERE "column.name" = 'value'` - Double-quoted identifiers in WHERE clauses
- `SELECT DISTINCT "column.name" FROM Sheet1` - Double-quoted identifiers in DISTINCT queries
- `SELECT "column.name" FROM Sheet1 GROUP BY "column.name"` - Double-quoted identifiers in GROUP BY
- `SELECT "column.name" FROM Sheet1 ORDER BY "column.name"` - Double-quoted identifiers in ORDER BY

## Examples

### Basic Query with Double-Quoted Identifier
```sql
SELECT "Purch.Doc." FROM Sheet1 LIMIT 1;
```

### Query with Condition
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 WHERE "Purch.Doc." = '12345';
```

### Distinct Values with Special Characters
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "Purch.Doc." FROM Sheet1 WHERE TRIM("Purch.Doc.") != '';
```

### Multiple Columns with Special Characters
```sql
SELECT "Order ID", "Customer.Name" FROM Orders;
```

## Implementation Details
- Double-quoted identifiers are parsed as `double_quote_string` type by node-sql-parser
- The implementation treats double-quoted strings as column references, not string literals
- Table alias support for double-quoted identifiers in JOIN operations
- Preserves original case and special characters within double quotes
- Compatible with existing single-quoted string literals

## Error Handling
- Unclosed double quotes will return appropriate SQL parsing errors
- Non-existent column names in double quotes will return null values (standard SQL behavior)
