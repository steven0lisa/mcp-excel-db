# F-13: Field Existence Validation

## Feature Description
When SQL queries reference non-existent fields, the system will now return clear error messages instead of silently returning null values. This helps users identify typos or incorrect field names in their queries.

## Supported Syntax
- `SELECT non_existent_field FROM table_name` - Returns error for non-existent fields
- `SELECT existing_field, non_existent_field FROM table_name` - Returns error if any field doesn't exist
- `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE non_existent_field = 'value'` - Returns error in WHERE clauses
- `SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY non_existent_field` - Returns error in ORDER BY clauses
- `SELECT non_existent_function(existing_field) FROM table_name` - Validates function arguments

## Examples

### Basic Field Validation
```sql
-- This will return an error if "CustomerName" doesn't exist
SELECT CustomerName FROM Orders;
```

### Multiple Field Validation
```sql
-- This will return an error if any of these fields don't exist
SELECT OrderID, CustomerName, OrderDate FROM Orders;
```

### Validation in WHERE Clause
```sql
-- This will return an error if "Status" field doesn't exist
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Status = 'Active';
```

### Validation in ORDER BY
```sql
-- This will return an error if "Price" field doesn't exist
SELECT * FROM Orders ORDER BY Price DESC;
```

### Function Argument Validation
```sql
-- This will return an error if "Description" field doesn't exist
SELECT UPPER(Description) FROM Products;
```

## Implementation Details
- Field existence validation is performed during query execution
- The system checks all referenced fields in SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and function calls
- Error messages clearly indicate which field is missing: `Field "field_name" does not exist in table "table_name"`
- Validation works with table aliases in JOIN operations
- Supports double-quoted identifiers for fields with special characters

## Error Messages
- `Field "CustomerName" does not exist in table "Orders"`
- `Field "non_existent_field" does not exist in table "Sheet1"`
- `Field "Purch.Doc." does not exist in table "Sheet1"` (for double-quoted identifiers)
