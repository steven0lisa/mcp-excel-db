# F-4: JOIN Operations

## Feature Description
Support JOIN operations to combine data from multiple worksheets.

## Supported JOIN Types
- `INNER JOIN` - Returns records that have matching values in both tables
- `LEFT JOIN` - Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table

## Supported Syntax
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1 [AS alias1]
[INNER|LEFT] JOIN table2 [AS alias2] ON condition
```

## Examples

### Inner Join
```sql
SELECT u.name, p.title 
FROM users u 
INNER JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
```

### Left Join
```sql
SELECT u.name, p.title 
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
```

### Multiple Joins
```sql
SELECT u.name, p.title, c.content
FROM users u
INNER JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
LEFT JOIN comments c ON p.id = c.post_id
```

### Join with WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT u.name, p.title
FROM users u
INNER JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE u.status = 'active'
```

## Implementation Details
- Supports table aliases in JOIN operations
- JOIN conditions support equality comparisons
- Column prefixing with table names to avoid conflicts
- Proper handling of NULL values in JOIN conditions
- Memory-efficient nested loop join algorithm
