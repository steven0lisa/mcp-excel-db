# F-3: Table Aliases

## Feature Description
Support table aliases using the AS keyword to simplify table references in queries.

## Supported Syntax
- `FROM table_name AS alias_name`
- `FROM table_name alias_name` (AS keyword is optional)

## Examples

### Basic Table Alias
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 AS s1
```

### Table Alias without AS Keyword
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sheet1 s1
```

### Column Reference with Table Alias
```sql
SELECT s1.name, s1.age FROM Sheet1 AS s1
```

### Table Alias in WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT s1.name FROM Sheet1 AS s1 WHERE s1.age > 18
```

## Implementation Details
- Table aliases are stored in a mapping for query execution
- Column references can use table alias prefix (alias.column)
- Aliases are case-sensitive
- Original table names remain accessible alongside aliases
